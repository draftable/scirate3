  h1 About job postings on SciRate

  hr

  p
    small Posted June-2021

  p The introduction of job postings on SciRate is a new, and presently
    <em>beta</em> feature. What this means is that we are actively soliciting
    feedback from the community, and from organisations and institutions interested
    in posting jobs.

  p We're introducing job ads for two main reasons:

  ul
    li Support the development of the quantum industry;
    li Raise money to support further development of SciRate.

  p By posting an ad here you help grow and support our community. ❤️


  h3 Why post an ad on SciRate?

  p SciRate is a completely <a
    href="http://github.com/scirate/">open-source</a> widely-used scientific
    social network with a large audience from the quantum computing community.

  p If you're looking to get your company in front of a large group of quantum
    practioners and researchers, then this is the place!


  h3 What kinds of jobs can be posted?

  p At this point, we're looking for technical jobs in the quantum computing
    industry as well as similarly-focused research/academic positions. These can
    include software-engineering jobs, hardware-focused roles, and pure research
    roles over the entire quantum computing/information ecosystem.
